# convoLib

# Presentation
The software is a set of functionalities that compose an open source library that allows to perform the convolution between impulse responses of acoustic enclosures and audio signals in real time. The library is presented as a primary set of source code files (.h and .cpp) programmed in C ++ language with the aim of facilitating its use in multiplatform audio applications.

convoLib is developed under the context of JUCE, an open source framework for the development of applications for mobile and desktop platforms, known particularly for its libraries for audio management and user interfaces (GUI). JUCE focuses on providing application developers (who usually need several third-party software libraries), a complete software development framework that allows to speed up the development of audio computing applications.
